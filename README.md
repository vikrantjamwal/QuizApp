Quiz App
====

### Project Overview
The Quiz App project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making your own Android app - taking it from the idea stage to building out the full app.

The goal is to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of your choice.

### What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

* Planning your app design before coding.
* Taking an app layout from drawing to XML code.
* Creating, positioning, and styling views.
* Creating interactivity through button clicks and Java code.
* Commenting and documenting your code.
